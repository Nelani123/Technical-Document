            Developers can’t manage a technology stack unless they know what’s
            going on, which is why an analytics platform, like Mixpanel, is such
            an important part of the tech stack. Each tool in your stack
            creates, analyzes, or ingests data, and to run most efficiently,
            those data sources need to link to one another.
          </p>

          <p>
            A technology stack, also called a solutions stack, technology
            infrastructure, or a data ecosystem, is a list of all the technology
            services used to build and run one single application. The social
            site Facebook, for example, is composed of a combination of coding
            frameworks and languages including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and
            ReactJS. This is Facebook’s ‘tech stack.’
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Developers talk about tech stacks because it makes it easy to
              communicate lots of information about how an application is built.
              The term is sometimes applied to marketing services (martech
              stacks) or sales services (sales stacks), but it originated in the
              software development community. A tech stack quickly summarizes
              the programming languages, frameworks, and tools a developer would
              need to interface with the application. Because most coding
              languages have well-known performance attributes and limitations,
              the tech stack hints at the overall application’s strengths and
              weaknesses.

            <li>
              If a programmer knows that a software service is built on PHP, for
              example, they know that it’s code base is probably large and
              difficult to debug. PHP is a notoriously inefficient coding
              language yet is used in most popular web applications. If a
              programmer knows that an application was built using Ruby on
              Rails, they know they’d have to learn the programming language
              Ruby to make any changes. Tech stacks are particularly useful for
              hiring developers. “Unless applicants are familiar with a tech
              stack’s frameworks and languages, or are willing to become
              familiar, they might not be a good fit,” said John Debs, a
              full-stack software engineer at messaging platform Lua. Companies
              trying to recruit developers often include their tech stack in job
              descriptions.

          <header>How To Build Your Tech Stack</header>
          <p>
            Different companies will require different tech stacks and no two
            are alike. Teams decide on which technologies they want to use and
            then build upon a core coding language, adding additional tools and
            services as they go.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The resulting bundle of services is called a ‘stack’ because each
              additional service builds upon those beneath it, which allows
              developers to customize the application.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developers designing an application that will be accessed by
              millions of people every day might choose programming languages
              that excel at what are known as high-read operations, meaning they
              can be accessed by many simultaneous users
            </li>
            <li>
              If the application is meant to crawl the web and gather
              information, developers might opt for high-write languages. All
              tech stacks are divided between the back end and front end, also
              known as server-side and client-side
            </li>

          <header>Overview of A Simple Tech Stack</header>
          <p>
            The technology stack consists of alot of coding frameworks, but in
            this overview we going to focus on the frontend coding frameworks as
            this is just an overview.Many frontend developers use three coding
            frameworks, HTML, CSS and Javascript. the de facto building blocks
            of the web, and client-side frameworks such as Angular, React,
            Stencil and Vue. Here is an example of a CSS code, if you wanted to
            make this paragraph appear pink and bold to people viewing your web
            page through a web browser, you’d use CSS code that looks like thi
          </p>
          <code> p { color:pink; font-weight:bold; } </code>
          <p>
            In this case, “p” (the paragraph) is called the “selector”—it’s the
            part of CSS code specifying which HTML element the CSS styling will
            effect.
          </p>
          <code> var a = "hello world" </code>

          <header>Rely on the open source community</header>
          <p>
            Developers around the world contribute to building open source tools
            that are free for use and available to anyone with an internet
            connection. The scope of the open source community and the utility
            it offers are staggering. “Open source software is probably what is
            behind the past 10-20 years of tech renaissance,” said Debs.
            “Anybody can stand on the shoulders of giants and build products
            with incredibly complicated underlying technology that they never
            could have built themselves
          </p>
          <p>
            You’re talking about a pool of billions of hours of people’s time,
            and contributions from experts in every domain.” Debs estimates that
            the software he uses everyday took other people millions of hours to
            write. Any engineering teams considering building a tech stack will
            have an easier time by relying, at least in part, on open source
            software.

          <p>
            Developers tend to favor languages they already know, but to build
            the best tech stack, it pays to step back and let the application’s
            purpose determine its technology. For example, will the application
            exist on mobile or on desktop? If on mobile, what apps? If desktop,
            what browsers? Is it a media site that will receive millions of
            daily visitors or mobile banking app that needs to be secure?
            Different programming languages, tools, and tech stacks lend
            themselves to each of these purposes. So might certain developers
            with relevant skills.

          <p>
            Developers can’t manage a technology stack unless they know what’s
            going on, which is why many use product analytics. Analytics
            platforms are designed to tie together data sources throughout the
            stack and provide granular user tracking. This allows developers to
            identify issues users experience within their application, to debug,
            and to fix the errors.

            Teams should price out the technologies needed to support their tech
            stack before building it. When in doubt, teams should overestimate
            the total cost and remember to include the variable price of
            engineering talent. Developers are often attracted to innovative
            languages that will bolster their skills and resume, and while
            mature programming languages may provide reliability, they may make
            it harder to hire top talent. Occasionally, cheaper technologies
            might cost more in terms of attracting top talent.
